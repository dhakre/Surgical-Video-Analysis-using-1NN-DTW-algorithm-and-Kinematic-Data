# Surgical-Video-Analysis-using-1NN-DTW-algorithm-and-Kinematic-Data

This was my internship project. The aim of this project was to use 1NN-DTW algorithm to develop a Java library to determine the surgical
gesture recognition efficiency of this algorithm. The three main types of surgical Tasks were considered for this project that were 
Knot Tying, Needle Passing and Suturing. The videos dataset that I have used was provided me that consisted of the surgical videos for 
all the three types of surgical tasks along with the transcripts file [to determine the start and end Frame of each surgical gesture for 
each video] and Kinematic Data files [had the kinemtaic values for each video of all the surgical task videos]. The code can be used to determine 
the efficiency of any other algorithms also, that can be used for determining gestures.
